# photocgsurvey-evaluation
This repository contains the evalutation scripts for the survey I did on distinguishing between photos and photo-realistic computer graphics images.
You can find the full evaluation at https://oweissbarth.de/photo-or-computer-graphics-the-survey-evaluation/

The code for all evaluation is in evaluations.py. The model is described in model.py. Running generate_evaluation.py loads the data  from the json file and creates visualistions in new html files based on the templates.
